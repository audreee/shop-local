## What It Is
A local business finder that finds local small businesses owned by members of vulnerable communities. This app was built in under 2 days as part of a challenge to build a "Minimum Viable Product" in less than 2 days.

## Why Should I Use It?
Although there has recently been an uptick in blog posts and media listing local, minority-owned businesses, there is a lack of centralized information. This web app collects and stores this information in one place and recommends nearby shops to support.

## How To Use:
1. Fork and clone the repo to your local machine
2. Install all dependencies with npm install
3. Create a config.js file in the root directory exporting a valid Google Maps API token
4. Run the npm script 'react-dev' to build a bundle using webpack
5. Run the server with the npm start script
6. Open localhost:3000 on your machine

## What Tools Did You Use?
- Node / Express
- React
- PostgreSQL
- Google Maps API
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Bootstrap (for spinner)
